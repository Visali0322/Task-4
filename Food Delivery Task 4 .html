    <p> The food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The A delivery order is a document that can be issued by the owner of freight, consignee, shipper or a carrier to deliver the goods to another party. A delivery order should be differentiated from the bill of lading. The delivery order is not a negotiable document and it does not act as evidence or receipt of good. Online food ordering is the process of ordering food, for delivery or pickup, from a website or other application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a virtual restaurant) or food that has not been specially prepared for direct consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits, frozen meats. etc).</p>
